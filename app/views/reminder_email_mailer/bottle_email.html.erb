    Hello!
    <div>
      It's been four weeks since you brewed(!) #batchname, so this is your reminder that it is probably time to rack. If you're going to age on the yeast then have no fear - we will email again in two more weeks to remind you to bottle (as if your thirst wasn't enough to remind you!)
    </div>
    <div>
      To look back fondly at your data you can <a href= "/dashboard"> head back to your dashboard</a> anytime, <a href= "http://bruby-app.herokuapp.com/dashboard">and maybe it's time to brew again, don't you think?!
    </div>
